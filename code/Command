watch tail -n 20 logs/v2as4_filters.log (track process)

MLI_AL_com_25 assume black inside, changed in emissivity.py in cryolib

Isodimension: inner diameter, width go out
materials in cryolib
 
conductivity.py get_conductivity

shapes in cyolib/filters.py

filters notice the thickness should match the actual filter thickness in library
